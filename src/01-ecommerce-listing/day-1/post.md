Welcome to Week 1, Day 1 of my Weekly UI challenge! As I stated in the
[announcement post](), week 1 will focus on an **ecommerce listing** UI
component; each day throughout this following week, I will pick one or two
(usually related) subelements of the design to implement. For day one, our goal
is toâ€¦

## Design the component

I personally used Sketch to design this week's component, but you can use
Sketch, a similar UX/UI design program like Adobe XD, or really any other
program (or just paper and pen/pencil!) to design your component.

If you decide you would rather not design your own component, you are more than
welcome to follow along using my designs, but I think you'd really get the most
of it if you designed your own. (plus I'd love to see what you all come up
with!)

Here is what the listing component will look like, including a number of the
component's alternative states:

This is what the various states of pieces of the component look like across a
row of listings:

## Now it is your turn

Hop on those design programs (or get out that pen and paper pad) and design your
own **ecommerce listing**! Below is a calendar of what features I will be
implementing on which day, as well as a few resources that may help you.

Also, please add your repos and/or images of your designs in the comments for
inspiration! I would love to see what designs you all create.

Happy designing! ðŸŽ‰
