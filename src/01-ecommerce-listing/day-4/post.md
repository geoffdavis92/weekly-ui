Welcome to Week 1, Day 4 of my Weekly UI challenge! As I stated in the [announcement post](https://dev.to/geoff/announcing-weekly-ui-challenge-h87), week 1 will focus on an **ecommerce listing** UI component; each day throughout this following week, I will pick one or two (usually related) subelements of the design to implement. For day four, our goal is toâ€¦

## Sale Price Display, Sold Out States

Sometimes when you are a business owner, you have to generate interest for your items or incentivize customers to purchase a product. With a brick-and-mortar store, perhaps that's a flashy sign or a kitschy local TV ad; with an online store, that could be a banner across the top of the listing, a ribbon decorating an upper corner of a product card, or a **SALE** callout on the listing, which is what I have configured. 

Conversely, it's nice to tell your customersâ€“ before they click through to the product pageâ€“ whether an item is still in stock or not. To aid my users in their search for products they can actually buy, I've added a **SOLD OUT** callout in place of a price.

Following the original design I created, this is what I've got for **Day 4**:

For the sale price display, I added a green callout, or "badge" as [it's referred to sometimes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/badge/). I then render the sale price next to it, naturally; to cap off the sale update, I strike-through the original price, so users can *see* their savings! (we're talking about *literally* slashing prices here)

For the sold out display, I actually use the same badge component with different props to make the border/text color red. No need to display the price for this product, since it is not available for sale; if this was hooked up to a larger ecommerce platform, you could/should still link the component through to the product page, and display the price there, for inquisitive minds and long-term planners.

Finally, in order to make sure the ecommerce database team doesn't need to go in and scrub some orders and issue apology emails, I need to disable the button and its function. Since this is a semantic `button` element, I can add the `disabled` attribute (or since I'm using React, a "prop") to render the button unclickable; to be safe, I also remove the `onClick` handler as well, and make the button grayscale for visual shoppers.

You can check out my coded implementation [on my Github pages site for this project](https://geoffdavis92.github.io/weekly-ui/).

## Now it's your turn

I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org) to develop my implementation, but you can use whatever technology stack you would like! (hint: if you use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org), you can still use [Storybook for those libraries](https://storybook.js.org/basics/slow-start-guide/))

You don't even have to use a view library if you don't want to; HTML and CSS-only (and non-view JavaScript library) components are more than possible, especially for this step.

Also, please add your repos and/or images of your designs in the comments for inspiration! I would love to see what designs you all create.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
