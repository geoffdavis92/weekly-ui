Welcome to Week 3, Day 2 of my Weekly UI challenge! Week 3 will focus on a **results page** UI component; each day throughout this following week, I will pick one or two (usually related) subelements of the design to implement. For day two, our goal is toâ€¦

## Add result entry, sponsored/best seller indicators

Following the original design I created, this is what I've got for **Day 2**:

## Now it's your turn

I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org) to develop my implementation, but you can use whatever technology stack you would like! (hint: if you use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org), you can still use [Storybook for those libraries](https://storybook.js.org/basics/slow-start-guide/))

You don't even have to use a view library if you don't want to; HTML and CSS-only (and non-view JavaScript library) components are more than possible, especially for this step.

Also, please add your repos and/or images of your designs in the comments for inspiration! I would love to see what designs you all create.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
